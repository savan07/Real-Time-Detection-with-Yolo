# Real-Time-Detection-with-Yolo
Real time detection using yolo models(Yolo v2, Yolo v2 tiny, Yolo v3, Yolo v3 tiny) with opencv. 
If you are using jupyter then just run .ipynb file otherwise you can also run .py file using cmd in windows or using terminal in linux (eg. Raspberry Pi).

I have tested it in Windows as well as in Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and its giving good fps on cpu as well.

And don't forget to download .weights file from the official website of Yolo, https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
